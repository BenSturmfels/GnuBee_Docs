GnuBee USB to UART

Most embedded System-on-chips come with an UART or TTL integrated into the System-on-chip to allow debugging, firmware replacement or serial connection.

The GnuBee Personal Cloud routes the UART connection to a 3.5mm (1/8") Audio Jack for convenient use.

The GnuBee USB to UART uses a Winchiphead CH340G USB to serial chip from Nanjing QinHeng Electronics Co.,Ltd. to convert the UART signal to USB.

The Linux kernel identifies this chipset as the "QinHeng Electronics HL-340 USB-Serial adapter"
Users of other Operating Systems can find drivers in the driver directory.
