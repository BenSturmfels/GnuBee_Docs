After shipping a small problem with a bracket was found.

It is possible for one of the brackets to touch the "C479" Capactitor or it's solder pad.
This point is connected to ground and thus should not cause any problem.

However there is an easy fix.
Simply remove the offending bracket corner with a pair of side cutting pliers.

The opposite bracket can touch the ethernet transformer however this has been found to cause no problems.
