# LEDE-project for GB-PC1

This Directory contains the current build of the LEDE-project for the GnuBee Personal Cloud One.
These builds are based on stable branch of LEDE 17.01

Some older builds are still available in dated sub-directories.

Currently we are making two builds available.
The 'lite' version contains a package set for running a basic NAS.
The 'full' version contains numerous addtional packages.

With community feedback we can tailor the package sets for these builds.
